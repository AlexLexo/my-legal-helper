Even if you can show that the defect was a dangerous hazard, the highway authority need only show that they had a 'reasonable system of inspection' in place to avoid blame. The frequency of inspections required will often be once every 3 - 6 months, depending on the type of road. If the highway authority can show that they inspected the road within that timescale then you would need to show that they missed the defect or that they should have been aware of the defect in any event, such as if people had complained about the defect since the inspection."

      "In this class of case a number of common factors fall to be considered:<br />the nature of the underlying injury which has resulted in facial disfigurement;<br />the nature and extent of treatment;<br />the nature and extent of the residual scarring or disfigurement;<br />the age of the claimant;<br />the subjective impact of the disfigurement upon the claimant including the extent to which they valued their appearance;<br />the extent to which the injury adversely affects the claimant’s social, domestic and work lives;<br />The psychological impact upon the claimant, which in severe cases may be very substantial.<br />The subject of burns is not dealt with separately. Burns of any degree of severity are particularly painful and disfiguring, and awards are invariably at the upper ends of the brackets, or above them altogether. The very worst burns may lead not only to considerable disfigurement and pain but to a variety of continuing physical and psychological injuries meriting very high awards. <br />(a) Very Severe Scarring<br />In a relatively young claimants (typically teens to early 30s) where the cosmetic effect is very disfiguring and the psychological reaction severe. £26,120 to £85,340<br />(b) Less Severe Scarring<br />Where the disfigurement is still substantial and where there is a significant psychological reaction. £15,750 to £42,460<br />(c) Significant Scarring<br />Where the worst effects have been or will be reduced by plastic surgery leaving some cosmetic disability and where the psychological reaction is not great or, having been considerable at the outset, has diminished to relatively minor proportions. £7,990 to £26,380<br />(d) Less Significant Scarring<br />In these cases there may be but one scar which can be camouflaged or, though there are a number of very small scars, the overall effect is to mar but not markedly to affect the appearance and the reaction is no more than that of an ordinarily sensitive young woman. £3,460 to £12,050<br />(e) Trivial Scarring<br />In these cases the effect is minor only. £1,500 to £3,090",

      "This is an area in which it is not possible to offer much useful guidance. The principles (including the approach to awards for different genders) are the same as those applied to cases of facial disfigurement. It must be remembered that many of the physical injuries already described involve some element of disfigurement and that element is of course taken into account in suggesting the appropriate bracket. There remain some cases where the element of disfigurement is the predominant one in the assessment of damages. Where the scarring is not to the face or is not usually visible then the awards will tend to be lower than those for facial or readily visible disfigurement.<br />A large proportion of awards for a number of noticeable laceration scars, or a single disfiguring scar, of leg(s) or arm(s) or hand(s) or back or chest, fall in the bracket of £6,870 to £19,930.<br />In cases where an exploratory laparotomy has been performed but no significant internal injury has been found, the award reflects the operation and the inevitable scar.<br />In the region of £7,580<br />A single noticeable scar, or several superficial scars, of leg(s) or arm(s) or hand(s), with some minor cosmetic deficit.<br />£2,080 to £6,870<br />As we have noted in Chapter 9, the effects of burns will normally be regarded as more serious since they tend to cause a greater degree of pain and may lead to continuing physical and psychological injury. Serious burn injuries will attract very significant awards. Where significant burns cover 40% or more of the body, awards are likely to exceed £91,910. Factors which will influence the size of award in burns cases will include:<br />The percentage body area affected by the burns;<br />Whether the burns are full thickness, partial thickness or superficial;<br />The cosmetic impact of the injuries and the injured person’s reaction to them;<br />The need for (and extent of) surgery;<br />Any resulting physical disability;<br />The psychological impact.",
