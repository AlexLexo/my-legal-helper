Go back to the scene to record the size of the defect and to take photographs with a tape measure in shot so you can accurately show how deep and wide it is. Winning these cases can be challenging. Even if you can show that the defect was a dangerous hazard, the highway authority need only show that they had a 'reasonable system of inspection' in place to avoid blame. The frequency of inspections required will often be once every 3 - 6 months, depending on the type of road. If the highway authority can show that they inspected the road within that timescale then you would need to show that they missed the defect or that they should have been aware of the defect in any event, such as if people had complained about the defect since the inspection.
